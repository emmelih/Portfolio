            'Bud’ is a furry friend which keeps tabs on your studying environment. Bud’ monitors the temperature, light, and noise of your environment and is meant to be placed on the table. At rest, Bud’ LEDs enter a "breathing pattern" and will activate other functionality when stroked. Stroke once, twice, or thrice to activate light, temperature, or noise mode. Bud’ will show different leds and colours depending on mode to visualize the different modes.',
            'This project was part of a course at KTH called Physical Interaction Design, where we were tasked to create a physical prototype of something, with a focus on the physical interaction itself. The theme of the prototype was "library" and to my team and I, we associate the library with studying. So we wanted to create something that would keep you company, as well as be useful. It took a few iterations to find out what we wanted our Bud\' to do, but that is all part of the process, and enabled us to think about the different materials and possible interactions.',
            'We were really able get creative and create something hands-on. Inside Bud\', there is a Arduino UNO controlling the sensors, and the lights under the fluffy material. On Bud\'s head we created a stroke sensor with conductive thread.',

The result of this work was that a robot was better perceived by the human interacting with it if it did not acknowledge its mistake, compared to when it apologized for its mistakes. Following this I had the opportunity to submit a paper with our mentor, based on the mentioned result.',

SEI is an international non-profit research organization working on environment and sustainable development issues. This visualization is based on the data collected and compiled by the SEI about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The main purpose of this data is to make it possible to analyze the interactions between different Sustainable Development Goals. Our visualization of this data set is intended to help researchers identify important connections and interactions between these goals. We used mainly D3.js and React to make it. '
