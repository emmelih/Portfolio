At rest, Bud’ LEDs enter a "breathing pattern" and will activate other functionality when stroked. Stroke once, twice, or thrice to activate light, temperature, or noise mode. Bud’ will show different leds and colours depending on mode to visualize the different modes.',
            'This project was part of a course at KTH called Physical Interaction Design, where we were tasked to create a physical prototype of something, with a focus on the physical interaction itself. The theme of the prototype was "library" and to my team and I, we associate the library with studying. So we wanted to create something that would keep you company, as well as be useful. It took a few iterations to find out what we wanted our Bud\' to do, but that is all part of the process, and enabled us to think about the different materials and possible interactions.',

It is an interactive musical play with lots of improve. During 2018 I was the producer. I recruited group leaders, made a plan for the project together with these group leaders and recruited significantly more members than the year before. I managed to make the project better organized than it has been before and we even sold all the tickets to our shows, which hasn’t been done since I started at KTH. I really enjoyed being the producer and all the challenges that entailed, and I learned a lot during the experience!'

            'With the advancement of technology, the tools for creating Augmented Reality (AR) applications have made it possible for developers to build applications for both entertainment and educational purposes. At the same time, technology is becoming increasingly common in the classroom, where laptops and tablets are replacing books and notepads. There is evidence which shows that technical tools in the classrooms are valuable learning aids, especially the high level of interactivity in AR which is shown to have a positive impact on learning AR in applications can add value to the physical world through virtual data and services.',
            'In this project, we aimed to develop an AR application that can provide children and people living in urban areas with a tool that creates a fun, on-the-go learning environment. The purpose of the application is to provide a tool to learn about animals living on a farm, using both visual and sonification modalities. AR is used to study future interaction possibilities of learning platforms which, traditionally, provide a 2D visual output. The aim is that the combination of AR, sound and physical movements of the body will provide a richer user experience and, hopefully, a more rapid learning curve.'

The field of haptics, using the haptic device Novint Falcon and the method normal mapping to create a texture one could “feel”, and Formal Analysis which is a way used to study how people perceive art.  Both were new fields for us and an interesting cross-disciplinary study to conduct. Testing haptics with participants was especially fun and interesting.',
          'Results were collected as text-answers in a survey. So there was a lot of qualitative data, which was interesting to analyze! Especially since we had mostly made use of quantitative data up until then. The question we aimed to answer was: How the user perceives a normal map of an image compared to looking at it visually? And what properties and styles of artworks are most similarly perceived?',
          'We had participant feel three artworks with the haptic device and answer the questions from the formal analysis. Then we had them see the same artworks without knowing they were the same and answer the same questions. The conclusions were that the properties that were the most similar were sharp lines and strong contrasts. The properties that were not similar were that abstract was perceived as figurative and vice versa.'
